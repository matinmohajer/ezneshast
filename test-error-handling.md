# Testing the Improved Error Handling

## What We Fixed

1. **No more 413 errors** - The API now tries multiple models instead of failing
2. **Always returns transcript** - Even if summarization fails, you get the transcript
3. **Graceful fallbacks** - Multiple fallback strategies ensure something always works
4. **User-friendly responses** - Clear status information about what succeeded/failed

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Test with Very Long Audio (Should Trigger Chunking)**

```bash
# Upload a 30+ minute meeting recording
curl -X POST /api/voice-meeting-minutes \
  -F "audio=@very-long-meeting.wav"
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Transcription succeeds
- ✅ Transcript is chunked into multiple parts
- ✅ Each chunk processed with appropriate model
- ✅ Results merged into final summary
- ✅ API returns success with transcript + summary

**Logs to Watch:**

```
[voice-meeting-minutes] Chunking transcript into 4 parts
[voice-meeting-minutes] Processing chunk 1/4 (12000 tokens)
[voice-meeting-minutes] Processing chunk 2/4 (13000 tokens)
[voice-meeting-minutes] Merging chunk summaries...
```

### 2. **Test with Extremely Long Audio (Should Use All Fallbacks)**

```bash
# Upload a 60+ minute meeting recording
curl -X POST /api/voice-meeting-minutes \
  -F "audio=@extremely-long-meeting.wav"
```

**Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Transcription succeeds
- ✅ Aggressive chunking with highest-capacity models
- ✅ Multiple fallback attempts if needed
- ✅ Always returns transcript + some form of summary

### 3. **Test API Response Format**

Check that the API response includes:

```json
{
  "transcript": "متن پیاده‌سازی شده...",
  "meetingMinutes": "خلاصه جلسه...",
  "summarization": {
    "success": true,
    "error": null,
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
  },
  "model": {
    "transcription": "scribe_v1",
    "summarization": "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
  },
  "language": "fa"
}
```

## Key Improvements to Verify

### ✅ **No More 413 Errors**

- The API should never return a 413 status
- Instead, it should try different models and strategies

### ✅ **Transcript Always Available**

- Even if summarization completely fails
- You should always get the `transcript` field

### ✅ **Fallback Summaries**

- If LLM summarization fails, you get a basic fallback summary
- The `summarization.success` field indicates what happened

### ✅ **Multiple Model Attempts**

- Watch logs for model switching:

```
[voice-meeting-minutes] Switching to recommended model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
[voice-meeting-minutes] Trying with last resort model: llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

### ✅ **Chunk-Level Resilience**

- Individual chunk failures don't break the entire process
- Each chunk gets multiple fallback attempts

## Monitoring Commands

### **Watch for Success Patterns:**

```bash
tail -f your-app.log | grep "Successfully\|completed\|processed"
```

### **Watch for Fallback Patterns:**

```bash
tail -f your-app.log | grep "fallback\|retrying\|switching"
```

### **Watch for Error Patterns:**

```bash
tail -f your-app.log | grep "Error\|failed\|Error processing"
```

## What Success Looks Like

### **For Short Audio:**

```
[voice-meeting-minutes] No chunking needed, processing normally
[voice-meeting-minutes] Summarization completed: { success: true, error: null }
```

### **For Long Audio:**

```
[voice-meeting-minutes] Chunking transcript into 3 parts
[voice-meeting-minutes] Processing chunk 1/3 (12000 tokens)
[voice-meeting-minutes] Processing chunk 2/3 (13000 tokens)
[voice-meeting-minutes] Processing chunk 3/3 (8000 tokens)
[voice-meeting-minutes] Merging chunk summaries...
[voice-meeting-minutes] Final merged summary length: 2500 characters
```

### **For Failed Summarization:**

```
[voice-meeting-minutes] Summarization failed: [error details]
[voice-meeting-minutes] Using fallback summary due to summarization failure
[voice-meeting-minutes] Summarization completed: { success: false, error: "..." }
```

## Expected API Behavior

1. **Never throws 413 errors** - tries multiple strategies instead
2. **Always returns transcript** - transcription success is guaranteed
3. **Provides fallback summaries** - even when LLM fails
4. **Clear status reporting** - know exactly what succeeded/failed
5. **Multiple recovery attempts** - tries different models and approaches

## If You Still See Issues

1. **Check the logs** - look for the new error handling messages
2. **Verify model availability** - ensure your Groq API key has access to all models
3. **Monitor chunking** - see if the chunking system is working
4. **Check fallback behavior** - verify fallback summaries are being generated

The system should now be much more resilient and user-friendly!
